# Chrome Extension Leads Tracker - [Project on Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/learn/learnjavascript/) by [Per Harald Borgen](https://github.com/perborgen)

## what
this is a browser extension that lets you save tabs by pasting the URL in the input field, or by clicking a button to automatically save current tab.

## when do i use this extension
i'm a self taught developer and i use this extension to save tabs when i do my study/research on the web. i find it hard to navigate through my bookmarks. (seriously, does anyone here open their bookmarks?) You can use it this way but [Per Harald Borgen](https://github.com/perborgen) intentionally designed this as leads tracker.

## how u can use this extension in 5 easy steps
1. download this repo as [zip file](https://github.com/ladyMariele/chrome-extension/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)
2. unzip file
3. in Chrome or Brave browser, go to the extensions page (`chrome://extensions` or `brave://extensions`)
4. enable "Developer Mode"
5. drag the folder anywhere on the page to import it (do not delete the folder afterwards)

## and...
that's it! ðŸ¥³ this is my first time building a browser extension and [Per Harald Borgen](https://github.com/perborgen) made it so easy and explained things in a fun and interactive way. ðŸ¤“

Happy web browsing!
